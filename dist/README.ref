SNOVA
=======
This directory contains a constant-time implementation of the SNOVA signature scheme.
The SNOVA parameters cannot be changed. Use the version in the `src` subdirectory if you want to use other parameters. 

Building
-------
Building SNOVA requires a C compiler, `make` and the OpenSSL library:
```
make clean all
```
This will create KAT files.
