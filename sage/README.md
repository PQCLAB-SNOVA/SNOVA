SNOVA in SageMath
=============

This directory contains a sage script `snova.sage` implementing SNOVA. It generates correct KAT files. The scripts supports the Rectangular SNOVA variant described in the appendix of `SNOVA_2.1.pdf`.

The scripts `smat_q.sage` and `smat16.sage` have been used to find and verify $S$ matrices that are irreducible for $l \in \{ 2, 3, 4, 5 \}$.
